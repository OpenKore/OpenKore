# eventMacro
My personal rework of openkore's macro plugin

TODO:

1 - Create more conditions, at least the same number as the old macro plugin had.
2 - Hook AI only when we are sure an automacro is to be activated.
3 - Transfer macro code check to parsing time.
4 - Review macro condition code parsing (old Parser.pm and Script.pm)
